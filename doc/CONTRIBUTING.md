# Contributing To Tupai

Tupai is an open-source operating system and relies on community contributions to exist. You can help develop it further by getting involved and submitting patches, testing code and documenting the architecture of the system.

## Ways To Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to Tupai.

### Submit Patches

If you find a bug, improve the code, or add a new feature, you can submit a pull request to the GitHub repository. If your patch is of sufficient quality and is bug-free, then it will be accepted into the Tupai codebase.

When submitting patches, please adhere to the code quality and style guidelines. Remember: The simpler a system is, the less likely it is to fail.

### Testing Tupai

You can clone Tupai to your own machine, compile it and test it. If you find a bug or something that should be improved, you can submit a patch or an issue to the GitHub repository.

### Documenting Tupai

Tupai is a rapidly-growing codebase. To understand and maintain it, good documentation is necessary. If you understand a particular part of the code thoroughly, you can document it by adding comments or wiki pages to help others get to grips with the system.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the following things:

- A GitHub account
- [Optional] A system capable of building Tupai (A POSIX-like environment, the appropriate compilers, etc.)
- [Optional] A machine to test Tupai (emulators such as QEMU, VirtualBox and Bochs work too, although regularly check your code works with real hardware)

### Clone Tupai

You can clone Tupai to your local machine like so:

``
git clone https://github.com/zesterer/tupai
``

### Building Tupai
